WiPlay, under the umbrella of WiGalaxy, stands as a dynamic dimension within the Wigo Ecosystem. It’s a unique platform where blockchain users can unleash their fun side and earn rewards by engaging in simple, yet thrilling, blockchain games. WiPlay pushes the boundary of what's possible within the world of play-to-earn, offering a gamified blend of entertainment and potential profitability.

> The pioneering game on WiPlay is [Predict](https://docs.wigoswap.io/wigalaxy-the-metaverse/wiplay/predict-game), a price prediction game that runs on the Fantom blockchain. Powered by Chainlink, Predict provides an exciting environment where players predict FTM prices to win rewards. The beta period of Predict saw enthusiastic participation from hundreds of players, with the [top 3 players](https://wigoswap.io/predict/leaderboard) alone participating in more than 10,000 rounds and winning over 4,000 $FTM.

With the anticipated updates on WiPlay, the platform aims to offer an even more enjoyable gaming experience. In addition to enhancing the Predict game, WiPlay is set to introduce the [Raffle](https://docs.wigoswap.io/wigalaxy-the-metaverse/wiplay/the-raffle) game, a new lottery-style experience offering even more chances to win.

**Predict**

The maiden game launched under WiPlay is [Predict](https://wigoswap.io/predict). This game invites users to forecast the price of the Fantom (FTM) token within 5-minute candlestick intervals. It’s a game of precision and intuition that adds an element of thrill to the price movements of FTM. The accuracy of the prediction decides the rewards, making 'Predict' not just a game of chance but also of skilled analysis and understanding of the market.



**Upcoming Game: Raffle**

The next game in line for WiPlay is Raffle. Much like a traditional lottery, 'Raffle' participants can win significant token rewards by purchasing tickets.

Facts:

* **Ticket Cost**: A single ticket will cost an amount set in the WIGO tokens equivalent to \~$X USD.
* **Entry Limit**: Users can purchase up to Y tickets at a time, with no overall limit.
* **Ticket Numbers**: Each ticket purchase generates a unique 6-digit number ranging from 0-9. For instance, "1-9-3-2-0-4."
* **Winning**: Numbers are matched from the left to win. The more numbers that match, the bigger the prize pool you'll share.
* **Security**: 'Raffle' utilizes Chainlink's implementation of [Verifiable Random Function](https://chain.link/vrf) (VRF) for secure and reliable randomness in number generation.
* **Bulk Purchase Discount**: Multiple ticket purchases at once yield bulk discounts.
* **Prize Sharing**: The prize amount won depends on the number of other winners in the same prize bracket. The more winners, the smaller the share of the prize pool per ticket.
